All frontend code is in 'client'. Core libraries:
- [d3](https://d3js.org/) for binding data to elements. 
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for managing modules.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ES6 transpilation
- [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) for test runner.
- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for bdd/unit tests.
- ...and a bunch of plugins for integrating them :). Check the package.json for details.  


To install and run:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
