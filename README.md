# Archigram
Archigram is a simple tool to help with drawing and visualizing diagrams.  Original purpose is to help with drawing software architecture diagrams.


All frontend code is in 'client'. Currently using:
- [d3](https://d3js.org/) for binding data to elements. 
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for managing modules.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ES6 transpilation

# Installation

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
